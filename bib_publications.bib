#Author Code	Role Description	Definition
#1	Conceptualization	Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and claims
#2	Data curation	Management of activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use
#3	Formal Analysis	Application of statistical, Mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze of synthesize study data.
#4	Funding Acquisition	Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication
#5	Investigation	Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically preformfving the experiments, or data/evidence collection.
#6	Methodology	Development of design of methodology; creation of models
#7	Project Administration	Management and coordination responsibility for research activity planning and execution.
#8	Resources	Provision of study materials reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.
#9	Software	Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.
#10	Supervision	Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.
#11	Validation	Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.
#12	Visualization	Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.
#13	Writing-Original Draft	Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).
#14	Writing-Reviewing and Editing	Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision - including pre- or post-publication stages.
